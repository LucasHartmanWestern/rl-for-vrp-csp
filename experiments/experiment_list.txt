Each experiment is a directory within this directory.

Each experiment directory should contain:
- `config.yaml`: Configuration for the experiment.
- `description.txt`: A description of the experiment.
- `Experiment Analysis.ipynb`: A notebook for analyzing the results of the experiment.

The first 6 experiments are used to determine the number of episodes and aggregations to use in each permutation.

- Season: spring
- Agent-per-zone

Experiment 24:
- Model: DQN + MADT
- Seed: 5555
- Season: spring

Experiments 25-145 are combinations of the following parameters.
There is one experiment for each combination of the following parameters:
- Model: [DQN, DDPG, POLYGRAD, DQN + ODT, DDPG + ODT, POLYGRAD + ODT, ALL + ODT, DQN + MADT, DDPG + MADT, POLYGRAD + MADT, ALL + MADT, CMA] (12 models)
- Seed: [1234, 5555, 2020, 5678, 9101] (5 seeds)
- Season: [summer, winter] (2 seasons)

Number of combinations = 12 * 5 * 2 = 120 experiments

Each experiment can be run to train the model, or to load a pretrained model and evaluate it.
The selection of training or evaluation is done by running the app_v2.py file and answering the prompts given.

Experiments 25-145 are ordered to cycle through each model (starting with DQN), and then each seed (starting with 1234), and then each season (starting with summer).

Experiment 25:
- Model: DQN
- Seed: 1234
- Season: summer
- Agent-per-car

...

Experiment 145:
- Model: CMA
- Seed: 9101
- Season: winter
- Agent-per-car
