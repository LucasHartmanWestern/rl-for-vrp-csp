Each experiment is a directory within this directory.

Each experiment directory should contain:
- `config.yaml`: Configuration for the experiment.
- `description.txt`: A description of the experiment.
- `Experiment Analysis.ipynb`: A notebook for analyzing the results of the experiment.

The first 27 experiments are used to determine the number of episodes and aggregations to use in each permutation.

Experiments 40 and onwards are combinations of the following parameters.

There is one experiment for each combination of the following parameters:
- Model: [DQN, PPO, DQN + ODT, PPO + ODT, ALL + ODT, CMA] (6 models)
- Seed: [1234, 5555, 2020, 5678, 9101] (5 seeds)
- Season: [summer, winter] (2 seasons)

Number of combinations = 12 * 5 * 2 = 120 experiments

Each experiment can be run to train the model, or to load a pretrained model and evaluate it.
The selection of training or evaluation is done by running the app_v2.py file and answering the prompts given.

Experiments 31-151 are ordered to cycle through each model (starting with DQN), and then each seed (starting with 1234), and then each season (starting with summer).

Experiment 31:
- Model: DQN
- Seed: 1234
- Season: summer
- Agent-per-car

...

Experiment 151:
- Model: CMA
- Seed: 9101
- Season: winter
- Agent-per-car
